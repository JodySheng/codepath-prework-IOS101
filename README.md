<br>&emsp;Only my WeChat friends can contact and see my posts

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. My macOS system at first was too old for Xcode, and I don't have enough storage to download the new OS system, so I have to remanage my memory several times and deleting unnecessarily large files.

2. Not familiar with Swift, but the Pre-work does not have too much coding. And the instruction is detail enough.
